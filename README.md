# Sensortag BLE

This project is an Android application in order to communicate with TI's Sensortag CC2650 in Bluetooth Low Energy.

I need to do my personnal application because im using an old phone (Nexus from google) and Android version (v4.4). Most of the BLE applications are not compatible with this old one and I need specific ATT/GATT functionalities.
Main functionalities will be :
 - BLE scan
 - Connec/Disconnect
 - ATT MTU exchange ?
 - ATT information request
 - ATT read by type request
 - ATT read request
 - ATT read by group type request
 - ATT write request
 - ATT handle value indication

This project is related with my pull request on Contiki : https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/pull/2250
